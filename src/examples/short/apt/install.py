This example shows how to use the apt package from python.
This shows how to install packages.

You need to run this as root

Why would you want to install packages this way? It's a lot more efficient
and less error prone than using apt-get(1) on the command line.
Check how long it take you to run apt-get(1) to install a bunch of packages
already installed and how long it takes this script to do the same work...
